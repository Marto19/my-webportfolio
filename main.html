                        <p>Hello friend. 
                            My name is Martin Trenkov and I am a graphic designer and a 
                            developer. I've studied graphic design and photography in the  <em> National High School Of Polypgrapgy 
                            And Photography.</em>  Currently I am studying computer science at 
                            <em>New Bulgarian University.</em> Except my interests in design and programming <br> I am very interested in
                            as well.

                        <p>Hello friend. Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe I should give you a 
                            name. But that's a slippery slope, you're only in my head, we have to remember that. Sh*t, this actually happened, I'm talking to 
                            an imaginary person. What I'm about to tell you is top secret. 
                            A conspiracy bigger than all of us. Studied graphic design and photography and video equipment at the National High School Of Polygraphy And Photography.
                             Currently studying computer science at  New Bulgarian University.
